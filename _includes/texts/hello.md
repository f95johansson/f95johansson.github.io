# Hello

My name is Fredrik Johansson and I'm a student currently studying Interaction Technology and Design at Ume√• University. An education which focus both on designing and developing software and interfaces. I find that these two fields are truly important, and I like to bring a special focus on the programming side. Please have a look at things I've done and worked on down below.
