    ## Eduroam Redesign
    Sometimes certain designs are simply confusing and
    thus unpracticle, especially when you're working with 
    untechnical users. This project was a redesign of a guide 
    for setting up the Eduroam network at Umeå University, 
    in connection with the Course *"Human-computer interaction"*

# Eduroam Redesign

<span class="preamble">
In conjunction with the course *"Human-computer interaction"*, this project created a redesign suggestion towards how the guide for setting up the network Eduroam at Umeå University should look, function and interact with the user. The focus was on good design according the established design principles from Donald Norman and Jakob Nielsen.

As the current guide and process for setting up the Eduroam network at Umeå University is frankly ridiculously convoluted and has a reputation to be complicated, we decided to create a new design suggestion how such a setup process could be improved, with better design. A lot focus went into user testing and design analyzing, to see why the current implementation and design fails for the users. A prototype also was created to see how the new redesign may be implemented and expand the mockup to accommodate the whole process.

As a comparison, the two images below show how the old (and current) guide describes the process to the user. I leave it up to the reader to figure out what one should actually do, as that is what the guide expects from the user.
