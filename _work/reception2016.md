# Reception 2016 for Interaktion Technology and Design

<span class="preamble">
For the 2016 reception of the new people joining the program *Interaktion Technology and Design*, I together with the group Project Lemon developed a site to show the schedule and general information about the reception. [mottagnin.interaktion.nu](http://mottagning.interaktion.nu).
</span>

As the project only had a limited time schedule we decided to not use any specific frameworks and only use native Javascript and PHP in our development. We started with designing from the features we wanted to include and those features that those managing the reception wanted to include. We decided that the website needed an admin page to be able to edit schedule and other information, as previous years site did not have this capability. With this admin page the site should be able to be reused for years to come.

The struggles we encountered during this project was animation across devices. The site didn't include much but some animation, and getting these animation to run smooth across, especially mobile, devices was the main problem we encountered. It required some deep look into the workings of web animation to solve these animation frame rate issues.

My personal involvement in this project was to create the admin pages and the PHP backend. Later I also helped out on solving the frame rate issues.
