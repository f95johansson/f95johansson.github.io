<div class="preamble">
My name is Fredrik Johansson and I'm a student currently studying Interaction Technology and Design at Ume√• University.
</div>

In my education there's both a focus on design and testing interfaces, software and other interactions, and a focus on developing the interfaces, software and interactions. I find that both these focuses are truly important for great software, though I find the software development side the not intriguing. I like to get down in to the nitty gritty backend programming, and I also like the program interface and see how it's actually used. I believe products must be great at the back and the front-end, to be intuitive, user-centered and provide a meaningful interaction, and still manage to be reliable and fast. And that's the reason I'm studying interaction design, to be able to create technology that actually makes sense.
