<div class="preamble">
My name is Fredrik Johansson and
I'm a student currently studying Interaction Technology and Design at Ume√• University.
</div>

The things I love working on and I do believe I'm good at is especially font-end or fullstack development, whether it's web development or designing other applications. If there is anything I have learned then it's that technology is pretty pointless unless the user knows how to use it. Products must be intuitive, user-centered and provide a meaningful interaction. And that's the reason I'm studying interaction design, to be able to make technology that actually makes sense.
