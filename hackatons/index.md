# Hackatons and Game Jams
These are the hackatons and game jams that I have participated in.

## Hackatons
* [Uniaden 2015](#) - The theme was "Code Green" and the group that I worked together with won this one with a "Emergency situation service".
* [Dohi 2014](#) - No special theme. For this one some friends and I worked together a small adventure game.

## Game Jams
* [Global Game Jam 2015](#) - The theme was "What do we do now?" in which myself and two other made a puzzle game, driven by dialog.
