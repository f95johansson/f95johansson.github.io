# Project Lemon

Project lemon started as with the goal to do more projects beside those from school. The group is fairly new and there isn't much work to be shown, however you can always checkout our [github organisation](https://github.com/ProjectLemon) if you want to see what we are working on.  
  
We are currently working on two projects, designing logos for [Ume√• Association of International Affairs](http://upfu.org/), and also developing our own party game for android, [Intense Orange](https://github.com/ProjectLemon/intense-orange).
