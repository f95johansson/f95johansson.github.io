The Arc Comic Reader is an application which does one thing and one thing well, reading comic book. It's design to both be easy to use, and have those advanced features.

The main focus that I wanted to learn and focus on with developing this application was memory management. A comic books are essentially a row of very large images, together with showing a gallery with all kinds of thumbnails, memory limitations was a real concern and had to dealt with nicely. To make the application both fast in loading the images, but still display them in good quality required some serious planning.
