# Malicious Mango

<span class="preamble">
With this project we, Project Lemon, created a hosting website for putting up resumes, cv:s, pdf based portfolio, or other documents. It’s suppose to be a fast and easy way to have documents hosted somewhere to link to, without the need of setting up a website.
</span>

In this project we used AngularJs for front end development and Golang with MySQL as the backend. The main purpose for use was to learn more about web based security, password handling and safe database management.

Note: this project is still in development.
